ngbe-1.2.5.1(release time: 2023/09/19)
- fix bug ethtool -C ethName adaptive-rx on/off adaptive-tx on/off.

ngbe-1.2.5(release time: 2023/07/11)
- fix bug in ECC error recovery flow. Change the device reset waiting time from 3s to 1s
- fix bug when the flash cannot be accessed, getting lldp status from flash would take too long time at driver loading time. 
  It will cause cpu stucked.
- fix bug when pf link is down, vf cannot detect the link change.
- fix bug that makes ethtool show advertised speed abnormal in autoneg off case.
- fix bug: the number of descriptors in tx/rx queue must be multiple of 128.
- To avoid the speed of internal phy from 1000M down to 100M/10M when signal is not good, set "disable fall 100M" bit of gphy reg.
- To avoid the speed of internal phy from 1000M down to 100M/10M when signal is not good, driver will retry auto-negotiation for 3 times 
  if gphy does not link to 1000m. This action can be switch on/off by macro and is off by default.
- Make "Disable completion timeout" macro on by default.
- change yt8521/8531 BMCR from 0x8240 t0 0x8140 in 1G autoneg off case. 
- do not do pcie hot reset when pcie error found if sriov is enabled.
- Add ngbe genphy_suspend and genphy_resume ops. Change flow of gphy initialization, only setup phy power in ngbe_probe
->ngbe_phy_init. When ngbe_open/close, just to phy_suspend and phy_resume.

to build ngbe, install kernel-header and kernel-devel packages corresponding to kernel version(command: uname -r).
then contact to us and get driver tgz file, uncompress tgz, go to src directory.
you can
in x86 platform:
compile the driver by executing "make"
install the driver by executing "make install"
in kylinft platform:
compile the driver by executing "make kylinft"
install the driver by executing "make kylinft_install"
load driver by executing "modprobe ngbe" or "modprobe ngbe [parameter=port1_value,port2_value]"
unload driver by executing "rmmod ngbe"

Command Line Parameters:
------------------------

Use ethtool, ifconfig, or ip link * to set or get the driver information, see man of these tools.
